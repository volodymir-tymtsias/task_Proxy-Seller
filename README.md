As an API, we use the service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

### Technologies used:
- ReactJS (pure)
- Must be compatible with NodeJS 14 version
- Assembling the project using WebPack

### Technical Task:
On the main page we have a list of users from where we can open the user's posts or albums

There must be access to the content of posts and albums.

The user must be able to share the link from anywhere in the application (it is understood that the routes must be built in such a way that when copying the URL of the page, the content is fixed).

Add a search on the page by one of the fields (username); I would also like to see asc desc sorting by the username field as well.
